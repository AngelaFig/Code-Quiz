# <Code-Quiz>

## Description
This project is the development of a web application that runs a timed multiple choice quiz that tests users on their basic coding knowledge. Once the user answers all five questions, they can type in their initials into a scoreboard that pops up on the screen. The scoreboard then displays their name and score. This information is simultaneously stored in local storage.   
If I could change one thing in this application, it would be that my timer does not stop running once the quiz is over.
